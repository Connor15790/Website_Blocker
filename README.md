Website Blocker Application

This Website Blocker application, developed using Python's Tkinter library, streamlines the process of blocking websites. Instead of manually editing system files, you can now block or unblock websites with a simple button click.

How to Use:

Run the Application: Open the executable file located inside the dist folder. Make sure to run it as an administrator.

Blocking Websites: Enter the URL of the website(s) you wish to block in the input field. Click the Block button, and the application will block the website's IP address, preventing access.

Unblocking Websites: To unblock a previously blocked website, enter the URL again and click the Unblock button.

Example:

To block WhatsApp and Facebook, enter the following URLs:

web.whatsapp.com, www.facebook.com

Then, press the Block button. These websites will be inaccessible from your PC until unblocked.
